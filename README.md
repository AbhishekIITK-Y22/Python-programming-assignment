# Random Forest Classifier for Education Prediction

This repository contains code for a machine learning model based on a Random Forest Classifier to predict education levels based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about individuals' constituencies, political affiliations, criminal history, financial status, and state.

## Files

1. `train.csv`: Training dataset containing features and target variable.
2. `test.csv`: Test dataset containing features for prediction.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
2.install the required dependencies using
pip install pandas scikit-learn
3.run using
python3 assignment.py
4.The predictions will be saved in submission_random_forest.csv.

##Dependencies
